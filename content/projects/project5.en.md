<p>&nbsp; </p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">During the third semester of the master's degree in management and in the contexte of the course programming tools in data science, we were asked to build a R package that runs a shiny application.</p>

</p>


The R package is available [<span style="color:black">**here**</span>](https://github.com/ptds2020/project-G1) or you can download it using the R command: 

```{r}
remotes::install_github("ptds2020/project-G1", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```
