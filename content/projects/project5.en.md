<p>&nbsp; </p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">During the third semester of the master's degree in management and in the contexte of the course programming tools in data science, we were asked to build a R package that runs a shiny application.</p> 

<p>&nbsp; </p>

The R package is available [here](https://github.com/ptds2020/project-G1) or you can download it using the R command: 

```{r}
remotes::install_github("ptds2020/project-G1", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

Click [<span style="color:blue">*here*</span>](https://myshinyapp.netlify.app) to use our application.
