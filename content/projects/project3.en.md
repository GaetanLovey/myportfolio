During the business intelligence and analyzing big data course of the first year of the master's degree in management at HEC Lausanne, we had to provide a data anaylsis containing a bunch of databases, an ETL process with an ETL workflow and a star schema, a data exploratory analysis and a modelling part. The subject to analyze was the area bike share of San Francisco.
