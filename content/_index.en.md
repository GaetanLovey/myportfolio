> I obtained my bachelor in Business Administration from HES-SO Valais/Wallis in 2018. Then, in 2021 I got a master's degree in Management at HEC Lausanne. Being very interested in statistics and data science, I chose the "business analytics" orientation of the program. Today, I work as a Data Scientist and project manager at FMV SA, a company active in hydroelectricity production, distribution and commercialization.
