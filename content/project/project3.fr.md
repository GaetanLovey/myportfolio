<p style="text-align:justify;">During the Business Intelligence and Analyzing Big Data course of the first year of the master in management at HEC Lausanne, we had to provide a data anaylsis containing a bunch of databases, an ETL process with an ETL workflow and a star schema, and a data exploratory analysis and a modelling part. The subject to analyze was the area bike share of San Francisco.</p>
