<p style="text-align:justify;">During the deep learning lecture, we made a project aiming to apply some deep learning techniques in a business context. We extracted data and built different deep learning models. The goal of our models was to detect if there was any crack in the photos of concrete taken by the drones or by the technicians. In other words, we modelled a binary classifier and thus a tool that detects possible damage to certain concrete infrastructures.</p>
