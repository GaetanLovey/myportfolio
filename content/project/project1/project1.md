As part of the Data Sience course in the first year of the master's degree in management at HEC Lausanne, we worked on a real project concerning data science. The goal of this project was to go through the complete data science process to answer specific questions about our chosen topic. To do so, we extracted and loaded the data, we cleaned the databases and practiced an eploratory data analysis. Then, we used some statistical tools to perform a statistical analysis and to design some visualisations of the data.
